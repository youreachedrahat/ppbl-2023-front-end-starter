# Re-using Code

In this course, we'd like to help you understand at least enough that you are able to re-use code.

## When you re-use code:
1. **Make sure you know how to use it.** Of course you can copy and paste any time. Even if you would not be able to write it, try to understand how it works.
2. **Check the license.** Make sure you're allowed to use the code.
3. **Try to contribute.** If you like [Aiken](https://aiken-lang.org/) or [plu-ts](https://pluts.harmoniclabs.tech/), [Mesh](https://meshjs.dev/) or [Lucid](https://github.com/spacebudz/lucid), [TxPipe](https://txpipe.io/) or this Plutus PBL course, all of these builders are accessible. Go say thanks. Go ask what you can do to help. Maybe contribute some documentation.

## Keep your goals in mind
What are your goals? If you completed the assignment in Lesson 103.1, you can go back and add additional goals.

## When you install a package, you are re-using code.
- [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/), [Cabal](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/), [Nix](https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/package-management/package-management.html),  [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) are all package managers.
- When you install a package using any of these tools, you are re-using code.

### For Example
In the PPBL2023 Plutus Template, in the file [ppbl2023-plutus-template.cabal](https://gitlab.com/gimbalabs/ppbl-2023/ppbl2023-plutus-template/-/blob/main/ppbl2023-plutus-template.cabal), there is a list of `build-depends` that looks like this:
```cabal
  build-depends:      base ^>=4.14.3.0
                    , aeson
                    , bytestring
                    , containers
                    , cardano-api
                    , data-default
                    , plutus-ledger-api
                    , plutus-tx-plugin
                    , plutus-tx
                    , text
                    , serialise
                    , plutus-core
                    , tagged
                    , prettyprinter
                    , cardano-api
```

Each of these build dependencies is a package that was written by other developers.

In Module 201, we will build a simple front-end for interacting with Cardano. We will start by installing a set of packages that will be used to an application.

## How to build re-usable code
- Create modules
- Build packages
- The GPTE CommitmentTx is an example of a re-usable component.

## Chat GPT
You can assess your own progress by using Chat GPT or GitHub Copilot.

Applies to ChatGPT, as much as it does to existing projects (ChatGPT was trained on those projects ... we'll play with it in Module 201.) --- by extension: not everyone needs to be a developer. No one can be an expert on everything. In this course you'll learn enough to understand code exists, so that you can apply it in your work projects, and you'll understand what needs to be done, so that you can lead project management.
