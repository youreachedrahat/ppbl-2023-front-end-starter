# Re-using Code

- Responsible use
- What are your goals?

- Code reuse: we will show you enough to be able to re-use code. To participate, ofc. Copying and pasting is a skill, and we'd like for you to be good at it. Applies to ChatGPT, as much as it does to existing projects (ChatGPT was trained on those projects ... we'll play with it in Module 201.) --- by extension: not everyone needs to be a developer. No one can be an expert on everything. In this course you'll learn enough to understand code exists, so that you can apply it in your work projects, and you'll understand what needs to be done, so that you can lead project management.
