## Module 103 Commitment Tx and Distribute Tx
In this Module, you have the option of making one of two [Commitments to completing Module 103](/module/103/commit).

After you complete a Commitment, the Commitment UTxO is unlocked, and tokens are sent back to your address in a Distribute Tx. The Distribute Tx also updates the metadatum asscoiated with your PPBL 2023 Token. Here are some details about how this works.

### If you Committed to "Module103 with GitLab":
A Plutus PBL teacher will look for a merge request to the [PPBL 2023 Token Registry](https://gitlab.com/gimbalabs/ppbl-2023/ppbl-2023-token-registry) that is associated with your PBL 2023 Token. When your merge request is approved, the Distribute Tx will be sent.

### If you Committed to "Module103 no GitLab":
You are already done! A Plutus PBL teacher will send a Distribute Tx after checking your "lucky number".

Why?

To see if you completed Module 102.

## Additional Mastery Data:
To close out the "Onboading" section of this course, your PPBL 2023 Token will be updated with mastery data for each of the first four modules: 100, 101, 102 and 103.

## How is Mastery Assessed?
#### Mastery data is added to your contributor token for each Module, not for every Student Learning Target.

In the Module 103 Distribute Tx, we will update your mastery datum based on the following evidence:

- Module 100: For SLT 100.4, did you mint a PPBL 2023 Token? If you committed to Module 103, you must have! So we'll say that you successfully got started, and add `Module100` to your mastery datum.
- Module 101: We are not currently considering any official evidence for Module 101. Can you imagine some ways to create evidence that students mastered at least one of the SLTs in Module 101? We will include `Module101` in the updated mastery datum for everyone.
- Module 102: If you were successful on SLTs 102.4 and 102.5, you were probably also successful on the first three SLTs for Module 102. So decide whether you have completed Module 102, we simply check whether your "lucky number" is not equal to 5. If your lucky number is changed, you will see `Module102` in your updated datum.
- Module 103: SLT 103.1, a git commit

There will not be evidence for every SLT in this course. So what can we measure? How do you want to talk about Mastery? This conversation is just getting started, thank you for being part of it.

## Onward to Building Background Knowledge
Over the next few modules, we will go deeper into one part of the dev stack at a time.
