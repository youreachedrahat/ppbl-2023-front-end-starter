## Module 103 Commitment Tx and Distribute Tx
In this Module, you have the option of making one of two [Commitments to completing Module 103](/module/103/commit).

After you complete a Commitment, the Commitment UTxO is unlocked, and sent back to your address in a Distribute Tx. The Distribute Tx also updates the metadatum asscoiated with your PPBL 2023 Token. Here are some details about how this works.

### If you Committed to "Module103 with GitLab"
A Plutus PBL teacher will look for a merge request to the [PPBL 2023 Token Registry](https://gitlab.com/gimbalabs/ppbl-2023/ppbl-2023-token-registry) that is associated with your PBL 2023 Token. When your merge request is approved, the Distribute Tx will be sent.

### If you Committed to "Module103 no GitLab"
You are already done! A Plutus PBL teacher will send a Distribute Tx after checking your lucky number.

### Additional Mastery Data
To close out the "Onboading" section of this course, your PPBL 2023 Token will be updated with mastery data for each of the first four modules: 100, 101, 102 and 103.

### How is Mastery Assessed?
In each Module
- 100: SLT 100.4, minting a token
- 101: No on-chain evidence - but can you imagine some ways that we could make some? Have we already?
- 102: SLTs 102.4 and 102.5, changing on-chain datum
- 103: SLT 103.1, a git commit

There will not be evidence for every SLT in this course. So what can we measure? How do you want to talk about Mastery? This conversation is just getting started, thank you for being part of it.

## Onward to Building Background Knowledge
- Now we go deeper into one part of the dev stack at a time.

## Unlocking Module 201
Module 201 will be released when 10 Distribute Tx are confirmed on chain. (Or 2023-04-10...whatever is later)
