## In PPBL 2023, you will learn by example

We shared a few modules and lessons already. Hopefully you got a feel for how this course will work. That's an example of learning by example.

## You will learn by doing

In this course you will learn by doing things. For example, lessons do not cover every precise detail of how you will acheive a Student Learning Target. Instead, lessons provide ways to get started, and suggest ways for you to explore.

## You will work on projects

In this course you will work on real Projects. For example, in Module 100 you minted a PPBL 2023 Contributor token, and in Module 102, you built transactions with it. Now that you are "Onboarded" to the PPBL 2023 Contributor Token project,

In this Module, we introduce another project called Gimbal Project Treasury and Escrow.

With each new project we introduce, we will also share current questions raised by the project.

For example, in Module 102, we introduced some questions about proof, reputation, and identity by giving you examples in the context of the contributor token. Which of these questions are you most curious about?

## You will learn how and where to contribute to projects

If PPBL 2023 is successful, it will help you find a way to contribute to a real project. There are many ways to contribute a project, and lots of projects are getting started on Cardano right now.

## You will see different ways to contribute

Writing code and building systems will always be great ways to contribute to projects. This course will provide opportunities to practice doing both.

And at the same time, not every contributor needs to be a developer. We will share ways to get started on different contribution pathways: for developers, non-developers, and anyone who might be trying to decide whether they know enough to understand what AI is telling them.

One way to contribute is to formulate new questions. For example, in Module 102, you began to see some questions about evidence and on-chain proof. These questions are essential to the development of the PPBL Contributor Token. Your answers to these questions will lead toward a different PPBL 2024 Contibutor token.

## You will see different places to contribute

We will introduce a variety of projects, and hope that you find at least one where you'd be excited to contribute. If you want to contribute here at Gimbalabs, we'd like to have you here! We'll also show you other places to contribute.

In Module 101, you saw some documentation for Aiken and plu-ts. You might have noticed that the [Aiken Hello World](https://aiken-lang.org/example--hello-world#getting-funds) and [Hello plu-ts](https://pluts.harmoniclabs.tech/docs/examples/Hello%20World#deployng-the-contract) guides explain more than just how to write your first smart contract. Did you keep going with the documentation? If so, what new questions do you have? What are you most excited about?

And maybe you have your own project in mind. You can invite other PPBL students to join you.

## You are part of work in progress

The Plutus PBL course is itself a project, where we are learning by doing, together. But we've done enough telling you in this Intro. Let's dive back into some project-based learning.
