## Introducing our Next Project
# Gimbal Project Treasury + Escrow

Gimbal Project Treasury and Escrow (GPTE) was featured in the Plutus PBL 2022 Course.

We will continue to explore GPTE in PPBL 2023.

### How GPTE works:

GPTE allows Contributors to make Commitments to working on Projects. When a Contributor completes a Project, GPTE creates an on-chain record of a successful Commitment.

1. To Commit to a Project, you can lock your PPBL 2023 Contributor Token in a "Commitment UTxO". In this case, the "Project" you are committing to is Module 103.
2. When you Commit to a Project, a claim is made on a Treasury Contract. The Treasury Contract provides tokens that are locked with the Contributor Token, in the Commitment UTxO.
3. The Commitment UTxO is locked at an Escrow Contract address.
4. When you complete a Project, the Commitment UTxO is unlocked, and sent back to you in a "Distribute Transaction".
5. The Distribute Tx also updates the Datum for your PPBL 2023 Token, providing an on-chain record of what you have completed in this course.

### Welcome, Contributor
In this case, our "Project" is Module 103. This is just an introduction to GPTE. In this course, you will learn how to build GPTE. We will investigate the smart contracts and explore how to create front-end components.

Most importantly, we will continue to ask tough questions about how GPTE should be built in the first place.

### How your Mastery Status will be updated
For additional details about how your Mastery Status will be updated in the Distribute Tx, please read the [Module 103 Summary](/modules/103/summary).
