# When you talk about Plutus are you talking about Plutus or Plutus (or Plutus)?

**In this course, you will learn how to write to UPLC (Plutus Core). One of the ways we will get there is by writing SCs in PlutusTx.**

Plutus Core is a **low-level** language used for the core logic of smart contracts, while Plutus Tx is a **higher-level** language used for writing the parts of the smart contract that interact with the Cardano blockchain.

> would a diagram be helpful? I remember this being one of the most confounding things when I began
("Plutus" being used to mean at least two different things )

This course is called Plutus PBL, and in this module we are going to show you how to create your first smart contracts
in Plutus **and in other languages**. 

This course is really about **Plutus Core**. 


You'll learn the role of Plutus Core by looking at the entire decentralized applications.

Great question! We must start by distinguishing between two different meanings of "Plutus".

## "Plutus" as in "PlutusTx"

[PlutusTx](https://plutus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/plutus-tx.html) is a human-readable programming language based on Haskell. When people say you have to know Haskell
to be a Plutus developer, this is what they are talkikng about.
"This is a plutus script. There are many ways to create a plutus script.

However, PlutusTx is just one part of the greater Plutus platform (need precise language here).

Initially, PlutusTx was the only way to write a Plutus Smart Contract. However, as we speak, new languages are emerging.

## "Plutus" as in "Untyped Plutus Core," or "UPLC"

Depending on your goals as a developer, you'll take different approaches. You will often hear UPLC referred to as "Plutus Core".


## What does it all mean for you?
If you want to be a Smart Contract developer, we strongly recommend getting nix set up. Or do we! That's the question for Sunday/Monday

If you want to build applications, maybe you just need to make friends with a SC dev.

Either way, this course is designed to help you understand how Cardano works, so that you can start building.

In this module, we will survey some approaches to building plutus scripts, and then in Module 102 and beyond, you'll start to see how to use them."
