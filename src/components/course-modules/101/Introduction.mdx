# Introduction to Module 101:

This course is called Plutus PBL, and in this module we are going to show you how to create your first smart contracts
in Plutus **and in other languages**. 

How can it be that we can write Plutus in languages other than Plutus?

Great question! We must start by distinguishing between two different meanings of "Plutus".

## "Plutus" as in "PlutusTx"

[PlutusTx](https://plutus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/plutus-tx.html) is a human-readable programming language based on Haskell. When people say you have to know Haskell
to be a Plutus developer, this is what they are talkikng about.
"This is a plutus script. There are many ways to create a plutus script.

However, PlutusTx is just one part of the greater Plutus platform (need precise language here).

## "Plutus" as in "Untyped Plutus Core," or "UPLC"

Depending on your goals as a developer, you'll take different approaches.

If you want to be a Smart Contract developer, we strongly recommend getting nix set up. Or do we! That's the question for Sunday/Monday

If you want to build applications, maybe you just need to make friends with a SC dev.

Either way, this course is designed to help you understand how Cardano works, so that you can start building.

In this module, we will survey some approaches to building plutus scripts, and then in Module 102 and beyond, you'll start to see how to use them."
