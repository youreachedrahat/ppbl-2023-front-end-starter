# How to set up a local Plutus development environment

## Step by Step:

### 1. Install Nix
- Go to [nixos.org](http://nixos.org)
- Click the "Download" button and follow the instructions for your operating system.
- The [Nix documentation](https://nixos.org/learn.html) is very good. If you are interested in understanding this tool, we recommend spending some time review the documentation.
- If you have questions, be sure to [drop a line on Gimbalabs Discord](https://discord.gg/Va7DXqSSn8) or [join us at Live Coding](/live-coding)

### 2. Clone the provided PPBL2023 Plutus Template from Gimbalabs
If you haven't already, create a new directory for course repos. Here is how to make a `ppbl2023` directory:
```bash
mkdir ppbl2023
cd ppbl2023
```

In `/ppbl2023`, clone the PPBL Plutus Template
```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/gimbalabs/ppbl-2023/ppbl2023-plutus-template
```

We will use this repository in Steps 5 and 6. Run `cd ..` to get back to `/ppbl2023`. Then continue to Step 3.

### 3. Clone plutus-apps repo
[The Plutus Application Framework](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus-apps), also known as `plutus-apps`, provides a range of tools for developing distributed applications on Cardano. It is not a perfect tool, and it may provide *more* tooling than you need right now. However, we find that when developers want to go deeper into creating dApps with Plutus, `plutus-apps` is a great place to start learning.

To get started, clone the [plutus-apps repo](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus-apps). Then, checkout the most recent version, which is currently `v1.2.0` (released March 2023).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus-apps
cd plutus-apps
git checkout v1.2.0
```
<br />
---

### 4. Use Nix to run `plutus-apps`
- As of the start of this course, nix is in transition.
- That is why there are two different commands you might try.

```bash
cd plutus-apps
nix develop
```
or:

```bash
GC_DONT_GC=1 nix develop
```

If you can explain exactly what this means, please reach out!

```bash
cd plutus-apps
nix-shell
```

It is possible that none of these will work for you. If that happens, we are ready to help you!

### 5. Run `cabal update` and then `cabal repl` in the PPBL2023 Plutus Template

```bash
[plutus-apps] ../ppbl2023-plutus-template $ cabal update
[plutus-apps] ../ppbl2023-plutus-template $ cabal repl
```

<br />
---

### 6. In the repl, write the Always Succeeds script
```bash
AlwaysSucceeds.Compiler> writeAlwaysSucceedsScript 
```

## Next Steps
Nice work! We will expand on the PPBL 2023 Plutus Template throughout the course - if you know how to use it, you will be able to follow along.
