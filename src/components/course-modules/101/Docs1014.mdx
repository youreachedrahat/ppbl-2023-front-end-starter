# Documentation Lesson 101.4

#### 101.4: Your own environment - and why it's wild right now
- Nix - is this learning target right?
- It's wild - as of the start of this course, nix is in transition. Just like other groups are building SC languages, the Nix/Haskell stack is in progress too.
- So what should we do about it? One option is to skip this lesson entirely - you can learn a lot of key concepts without touching this lesson.
- However, maybe you want to participate. Here's how.
	- I can get `nix-shell` working...
- We'll continue to update this Lesson AND this Module in the months to come.
- Collect some links and questions from `ask-nix-nixos` in IOG Technical
- Share Discord links too: IOG, MLabs, etc
