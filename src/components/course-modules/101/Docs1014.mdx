# How to set up a local Plutus development environment

## Step by Step:

### 1. Install Nix
- Go to [nixos.org](http://nixos.org)
- Click the "Download" button and follow the instructions for your operating system.
- The [Nix documentation](https://nixos.org/learn.html) is very good. If you are interested in understanding this tool, we recommend spending some time review the documentation.
- If you have questions, be sure to [drop a line on Gimbalabs Discord](https://discord.gg/Va7DXqSSn8) or [join us at Live Coding](/live-coding)

### 2. Clone the provided Plutus Starter from Gimbalabs
```bash
git clone ...
```

We will use this repository in Step 5. First, we must install and run "plutus-apps".

### 3. Clone plutus-apps repo
[The Plutus Application Framework](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus-apps), also known as `plutus-apps`, provides a range of tools for developing distributed applications on Cardano. It is not a perfect tool, and it may provide more tooling than you need right now. However, we find that when developers want to go deeper into creating dApps with Plutus, `plutus-apps` is a great place to start learning.

To get started, clone the [plutus-apps repo](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus-apps). Then, check out the most recent version, which is currently `v1.2.0` (released March 2023).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus-apps
cd plutus-apps
git checkout v1.2.0
```
<br />
---

### 4. In `plutus-apps`, run `nix develop` or `nix-shell`
- As of the start of this course, nix is in transition.
- That is why there are two different commands you might try.

```bash
cd plutus-apps
nix develop
```
or:

```bash
cd plutus-apps
nix-shell
```

It is possible that both of these will not work. If that happens, we will be ready to help you!

### 5. Run `cabal repl` in the Gimblabs Starter, and write a validator

Now that you have completed this steps, you have a lot of power. We know this was challenging, but from here, you are ready to test ideas locally without depending on...

### Some choices:

- `plutus-apps` checkout `v1.2.0`
- `nix develop`
- `cabal repl` in GPTE Plutus on branch `small.cabal`
- We can build always succeeds from here.

## This story is still unfolding!
- Connect to status of all of these SC languages right now -- when will each be "safe"?
- So what should we do about it? One option is to skip this lesson entirely - you can learn a lot of key concepts without touching this lesson.
- However, maybe you want to participate. Here's how.
  - I can get `nix develop` working...
  - Or if not, at least `nix-shell` -- will continue to develop / troubleshoot!
- We'll continue to update this Lesson AND this Module in the months to come.

## Is PlutusTx worth it?

Good question. We're really not sure, and we are paying close attention to other options (and sharing them with you in this course). We will continue to investigate options for building applications on Cardano.
