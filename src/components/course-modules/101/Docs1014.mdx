# Documentation Lesson 101.4

#### 101.4: Your own environment - and why it's wild right now
- Nix - is this learning target right?
- It's wild - as of the start of this course, nix is in transition. Just like other groups are building SC languages, the Nix/Haskell stack is in progress too.
- So what should we do about it? One option is to skip this lesson entirely - you can learn a lot of key concepts without touching this lesson.
- However, maybe you want to participate. Here's how.
	- I can get `nix develop` working...
	- Or if not, at least `nix-shell` -- will continue to develop / troubleshoot!
- We'll continue to update this Lesson AND this Module in the months to come.
- Collect some links and questions from `ask-nix-nixos` in IOG Technical
- Share Discord links too: IOG, MLabs, etc

#### One approach that works:
- `plutus-apps` checkout `v1.2.0`
- `nix develop`
- `cabal repl` in GPTE Plutus on branch `small.cabal`
- We can build always succeeds from here.

#### What does this approach require?
- Install nix
- Clone our starter repo (whatever it is!) -- make it.
- Clone plutus-apps, start nix shell (takes time, bandwidth, hard drive)
- `cd` to starter - run cabal repl
- Compile...
