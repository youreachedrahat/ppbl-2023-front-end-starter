### How to set up a local Plutus development environment

## Is it worth it?
That's up to you. We still think so, but we are paying close attention to other options (and sharing them with you in this course).

## Getting Started
- Prereqs
- Hardware constraints

## Step By Step
### Install Nix

### Clone plutus-apps repo
Clone the repo and checkout...
```bash
git clone ...
cd plutus-apps
git checkout v1.2.0
```

### Clone the provide Plutus Starter from Gimbalabs

### Finally, compile!
Now that you have completed this steps, you have a lot of power. We know this was challenging, but from here, you are ready to test ideas locally without depending on...

### Some choices:
- `plutus-apps` checkout `v1.2.0`
- `nix develop`
- `cabal repl` in GPTE Plutus on branch `small.cabal`
- We can build always succeeds from here.

## The Plot Thickens - YOU ARE IN IT
- It's wild - as of the start of this course, nix is in transition. Just like other groups are building SC languages, the Nix/Haskell stack is in progress too.
- So what should we do about it? One option is to skip this lesson entirely - you can learn a lot of key concepts without touching this lesson.
- However, maybe you want to participate. Here's how.
	- I can get `nix develop` working...
	- Or if not, at least `nix-shell` -- will continue to develop / troubleshoot!
- We'll continue to update this Lesson AND this Module in the months to come.
- Collect some links and questions from `ask-nix-nixos` in IOG Technical
- Share Discord links too: IOG, MLabs, etc
