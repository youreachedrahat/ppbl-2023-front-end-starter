### How to use Demeter.run to compile an Always Succeeds script from PlutusTx

## Getting Started
- Create an account on Demeter.run
- Review PPP lecture:
- We can use different repositories. For this exmaple, we use https://github.com/txpipe/plutus-starter-kit from TxPipe

## Step by Step
	- Using: https://github.com/txpipe/plutus-starter-kit - get up to step of opening vs code
	- When you open VS Code in the browser, `cabal update` will run. This may take a while the first time. When that's complete, you'll get a message to close the terminal.
	- Close terminal and reopen.
	- (All of this is much faster after the first time - as you'll see locally too)
	- Now run `cabal repl`
	- We can play around
	- Read repo docs - see how some nice Haskell is provided.
	- But this is a pretty advance validator already! Our goal is to make one that will always work.
	- Ok and you can keep the hello.plutus as well - that might be fun for some future experiments!
## NEAT | IMPORTANT | TOUGH
- Next up: try some other templates. Try Plutus Pioneers.
- What we didn't cover: versioning - this template is from December...
