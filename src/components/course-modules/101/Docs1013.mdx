### How to use Demeter.run to compile an Always Succeeds script from PlutusTx

## Step by Step: Overview
1. Create a free account at [demeter.run](https://demeter.run)
2. Start a project with the [Plutus Hello World repo from TxPipe](https://github.com/txpipe/plutus-starter-kit)
3. Open Visual Studio Code in the browser
4. Wait for `cabal update` to run
5. Run `exec` -- check and add notes

## Step by Step: Details
- Using: https://github.com/txpipe/plutus-starter-kit - get up to step of opening vs code
- When you open VS Code in the browser, `cabal update` will run. This may take a while the first time. When that's complete, you'll get a message to close the terminal.
- Close terminal and reopen.
- (All of this is much faster after the first time - as you'll see locally too)
- Now run `cabal repl`
- We can play around
- Read repo docs - see how some nice Haskell is provided.
- But this is a pretty advance validator already! Our goal is to make one that will always work.
- Ok and you can keep the hello.plutus as well - that might be fun for some future experiments!

## Notes (video?)
How does versioning work in Plutus?

## Keep Exploring:
- Review [this Plutus Pioneers lecture that introduces Demeter.run](https://iog-academy.gitbook.io/plutus-pioneers-program-fourth-cohort/lectures/lecture-01/lesson-01)
- Try starting a project in Demeter.run from different starter template. You can [review some options here]().
