# How to unlock tokens from a contract address
Unlocking tokens is little bit more complicated than locking tokens. 

In an unlocking transaction, we must

## With Plutus Script and Inline Datum
Now you have seen your first transactions - we can use our plutus scripts!

```bash
CONTRACT_UTXO=
PLUTUS_SCRIPT_FILE=
COLLATERAL=
```

This time protocol params are required. Look at some errors.

```bash
cardano-cli transaction build \
--testnet-magic 1 \
--tx-in $CONTRACT_UTXO \
--tx-in-script-file $PLUTUS_SCRIPT_FILE \
--tx-in-inline-datum-present \
--tx-in-redeemer-value 1000 \
--tx-in-collateral $COLLATERAL \
--change-address $SENDER_ADDRESS \
--protocol-params-file protocol.json \
--out-file unlock-always-succeeds.raw

cardano-cli transaction sign \
--signing-key-file $SENDER_KEY \
--testnet-magic 1 \
--tx-body-file unlock-always-succeeds.raw \
--out-file unlock-always-succeeds.signed

cardano-cli transaction submit \
--tx-file unlock-always-succeeds.signed \
--testnet-magic 1
```

## Introduction to Reference Scripts

## Hashing Datum - Even in Always Succeeds, Datum Must Match:
In this lesson you will unlock the UTxO that you locked in [Lesson 102.4](/modules/102/1024). The contract is an always succeeds contract, which means that anyone can unlock it, but even so, we must make sure that that datum matches. 

Throughout this course, you will see different scenarios for unlocking UTxOs from Contract Addresses. The purpose of this example is to give you a place to start.
