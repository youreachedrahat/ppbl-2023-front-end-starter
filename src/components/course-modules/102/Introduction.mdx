# Welcome to Module 102: Build Your First Transactions

If you have ever used a Cardano wallet, you probably have sent a transaction. 

So what does it actually mean to send a transaction? What is your Browser Wallet actually doing when you type a password and send tokens from one blockchain address to another? In this module we will start to investigate these questions.

We will look "behind the scenes" and start to understand how Cardano transactions are constructed. To do so, we will use a tool called `cardano-cli`. If we are looking for convenience, `cardano-cli` is going never to replace Nami or Eternl. However, if we are seeking to understand how Cardano works, it is helpful to build some transactions step by step, and that is what you will do in this Module. 

By doing so, you might develop a greater appreciation for what convenient browser wallets do for us. You might also have some new ideas for what tools we'll build next.
