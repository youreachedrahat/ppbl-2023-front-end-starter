## Helpful Bash scripts
In the [PPBL 2023 Plutus Template]() or [PPBL Toolbox]() bash scripts for everything covered in this Module.

Suggestions for how to use them:
- Reading for understanding (markdown is provided as well)
- Using for quick utility - remix/reuse etc - got any you want to share? That's what Module 103 is all about!

If you are using Demeter run, you can update the git repo from VS Code

- A link to a bash course
