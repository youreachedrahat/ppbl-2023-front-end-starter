# Build a Simple Tx with cardano-cli

## Definitions: Transactions and UTxOs
- A "transaction" is used to move value from one address to another on Cardano
- Every transaction takes one or more UTxOs as input and creates one or more UTxOs as output.

Deep look at Live Coding April 5 or so.
As always, the video above provides a quick overview and some tips...

## 1. Set Variables and Select UTxOs
It can help to set some variables that we will reuse. For example,
```bash
$ SENDER=<THE ADDRESS GENERATED IN LESSON 102.2>
$ SENDERKEY=<THE SIGNING KEY FOR THIS ADDRESS>
```

Then, view your list of UTxOs by using:
```bash
$ cardano-cli query utxo --testnet-magic 1 --address $SENDER
```

We can also set a variable for the UTxO we want to spend:
```bash
$ UTXO_IN=<TxHash>#<TxId>
```

## 2. Build a Tx

Here is a simple transaction with one input and two outputs:
```bash
$ cardano-cli transaction build \
--testnet-magic 1 \
--tx-in
--tx-out
--change-address
...
```

## 3. Sign a Tx
### By copy and pasting:
```bash
$ cardano-cli transaction sign \

```

## 4. Submit a Tx
### By copy and pasting:
```bash
$ cardano-cli transaction submit \

```

## Put it all together:
