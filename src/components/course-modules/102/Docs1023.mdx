# Lesson 102.3 Documentation

## 102.3: build simple tx
- On the front end, a confirmation form

```bash
cardano-cli transaction build \

```

## Check if Tx has been sent from address
With a GraphQL query
<CheckTxFromAddressWithPolicyID />

## Note: UTxOs vs. Transactions
We can query either - so how?
