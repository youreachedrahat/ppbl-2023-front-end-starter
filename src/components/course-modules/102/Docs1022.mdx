## Building contract addresses
Now that you have seen how to build a wallet address, let's take a look at some Contract Addresses. Now is a good time to review Lesson 101.1
```bash
cardano-cli address build --payment-script-file
```

## Creating Proof!
It is time for some on chain proof. Use this form to check if you have sent your Contrib token to this address...
<CheckAddress />

## But is it really Proof?

### That is ok, but how do we know this is your address? You could have given us any address, really!
If you are asking this question - welcome to the party! Now we are ready to think a bit more about your Contributor token.

<br />

## What's Next?
- In Lesson 102.3, we will build a simple transaction that sends your Contributor Token from, and then back to, your Browser Wallet.
- In Lesson 102.4 we will build our first transactions using the contract addresses above.
