# 102.2: Create Wallet

- `cardano-cli address build` - for both keys and validator scripts
- let's take a look at some contract addresses
- FUN - review each of the Plutus scripts --> into docs

## Building a wallet address

### Here is how:

```bash
cardano-cli address key-gen \
--verification-key-file payment.vkey \
--signing-key-file payment.skey

cardano-cli stake-address key-gen \
--verification-key-file stake.vkey \
--signing-key-file stake.skey

cardano-cli address build \
--payment-verification-key-file payment.vkey \
--stake-verification-key-file stake.vkey \
--out-file payment.addr \
--testnet-magic 1
```

### And here is a script:

## Building a contract address
The process to build a Contract Address is similar to building a wallet address.

Now that you have seen how to build a wallet address, let's take a look at some Contract Addresses. Now is a good time to review Lesson 101.1

```bash
cardano-cli address build --testnet-magic 1 --payment-script-file always-succeeds.plutus
```

## Demonstrate Mastery
To demonstrate mastery of SLT 102.2, send your PPBL 2023 to the new address you generated with `cardano-cli`.

If you feel uncertain about doing this, try sending just a few `tAda` first. Then, look for your address on [Cardanoscan Preprod](https://preprod.cardanoscan.io), to confirm that the transaction worked.

<br />
---

## Proof of Mastery?

It is time for some on chain proof. Use this form to check if you have sent your Contrib token to this address...

<CheckAddress />

### But is it really Proof?

That is ok, but how do we know this is your address? You could have given us any address, really! If you are asking this question - welcome to the party! Now we are ready to think a bit more about your Contributor token.

<br />
---

## What's Next?

- In Lesson 102.3, we will build a simple transaction that sends your Contributor Token from, and then back to, your Browser Wallet.
- In Lesson 102.4 we will build our first transactions using the contract addresses above.
