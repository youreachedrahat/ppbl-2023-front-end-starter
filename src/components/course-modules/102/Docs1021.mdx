# How to query the blockchain with cardano-cli

Let's start with some good news: after you install Cardano Node and synchronize it with the Cardano network, it's really easy to query the blockchain using `cardano-cli`.

The bad news is that setting up a Cardano Node for the first time can be very time consuming, and there are strict hardware requirements.

Luckily, there is some more good news to follow that! If you cannot set up Cardano Node on your own computer, it is provided by [Demeter.run](https://demeter.run).

## How to know you're successful:
You will know you are successful on SLT 102.1 if you can run `cardano-cli query tip` and see that your node is synced to 100%.

When you write this query:
```bash
$ cardano-cli query tip --testnet-magic 1
```

You should see a result like this:


```bash
{
    "block": 744805,
    "epoch": 58,
    "era": "Babbage",
    "hash": "914c7d9277fbe2de044a2ed2948d2a9cec92459ef0421e84f1f60c5d4d5dcbde",
    "slot": 23653837,
    "syncProgress": "100.00"
}
```
Our goal is to see the `syncProgress` is at "100.00". Let's talk about how to get there.

## Run cardano-node (and cardano-cli) on your computer


### What is Cardano Node?
- A Cardano Node is the software that runs the Cardano blockchain. Here are some resources for learning more about it:
- [https://docs.cardano.org/learn/cardano-node](https://docs.cardano.org/learn/cardano-node)
- [https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node)

### What is Cardano Command Line Tool (cardano-cli)?
When you install Cardano Node, you also get `cardano-cli` along with it.
- [cardano-cli reference]()

### Install cardano-node and cardano-cli
> [https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node)
- Downloading binary vs. building from source
- Video: a few things to point out

### Download Configuation Files
Most important to highlight config files: [https://book.world.dev.cardano.org/environments.html](https://book.world.dev.cardano.org/environments.html).

### Run cardano-node
Provide the boilerplate for starting a node. In docs + as script

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

cardano-node run \
--topology ~/src/testnet-config-preproduction/topology.json \
--database-path ~/hd2/cardano/testnet-pre-production/db \
--socket-path ~/hd2/cardano/testnet-pre-production/db/node.socket \
--host-addr 0.0.0.0 \
--port 3001 \
--config ~/src/testnet-config-preproduction/config.json

```
