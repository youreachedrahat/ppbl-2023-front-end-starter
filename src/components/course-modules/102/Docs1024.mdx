# How to lock tokens at a contract address

Locking tokens at a contract is very similar to sending a transaction to any wallet address, with one key difference:

### When sending a transaction to a contract address, we must include datum in the tx-out.

---

## Which Always Succeeds will you use?
- Before you build a locking Tx, you decide which "Always Succeeds" contract to use. Some options are [summarized in Module 101](/modules/101/summary).
- You can build the address for any Plutus script, as shown in [Lessson 102.2](/modules/102/1022).

## Locking Funds is a simple tx
- But we need datum.

## Step By Step

## Putting it all together:
```bash
cardano-cli transaction build \
--babbage-era \
--testnet-magic 1 \
--tx-in $UTXO_IN \
--tx-out $SENDERADDRESS+$LOVELACE_TO_SEND \
--change-address $SENDERADDRESS \
--out-file simple-tx.raw

cardano-cli transaction sign \
--signing-key-file $SENDERKEY \
--testnet-magic 1 \
--tx-body-file simple-tx.raw \
--out-file simple-tx.signed

cardano-cli transaction submit \
--tx-file simple-tx.signed \
--testnet-magic 1
```
