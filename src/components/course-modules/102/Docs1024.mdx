# How to lock tokens at a contract address

## What is Datum?
Datum is information that can be included in a UTxO. When you `query utxo` for a address with `cardano-cli`, you can see whether each UTxO includes datum. Watch the video above to see how.

You will use datum in a variety of ways throughout this course. For now, watch the video above for a quick overview, and look at the `transaction build` below to see how to include datum in a `tx-out`.

## Which Always Succeeds will you use?
- Before you build a locking Tx, decide which "Always Succeeds" contract to use. You can use any of the [Always Succeeds contracts that were built in Module 101, as summarized here](/modules/101/summary).
- After you decide which Always Succeeds scripts to use, build the address for that Plutus script, as shown in [Lessson 102.2](/modules/102/1022).

## Set Variables:
```bash
SENDER_ADDRESS=
SENDER_KEY=
CONTRACT_ADDRESS=
UTXO_IN=
LOVELACE_TO_LOCK=
```

## Build, Sign and Submit Transaction:
```bash
cardano-cli transaction build \
--babbage-era \
--testnet-magic 1 \
--tx-in $UTXO_IN \
--tx-out $CONTRACT_ADDRESS+$LOVELACE_TO_LOCK \
--tx-out-inline-datum-value 1618 \
--change-address $SENDER_ADDRESS \
--out-file lock-always-succeeds.raw

cardano-cli transaction sign \
--signing-key-file $SENDER_KEY \
--testnet-magic 1 \
--tx-body-file lock-always-succeeds.raw \
--out-file lock-always-succeeds.signed

cardano-cli transaction submit \
--tx-file lock-always-succeeds.signed \
--testnet-magic 1
```

In Lesson 102.5, you will learn how to unlock tokens from the Always Succeeds contract address.
