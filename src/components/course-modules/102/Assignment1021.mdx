# Module 102, Mastery Assignment #1: Build Two Transactions
#### This is a guided Mastery Assignment.

This documentation will help you get started on a task, and you will have a chance to demonstrate mastery of some SLTs.

Hopefully you will learn some things along the way. We will encounter some questions about how the blockchain works.

When you are done, there will be on-chain evidence of your success!

## In this assignment you will demonstrate mastery of these learning targets:
<SLTSmall moduleNumber={102} id="102.1" />
<SLTSmall moduleNumber={102} id="102.2" />
<SLTSmall moduleNumber={102} id="102.3" />

<br />

## How will I demonstrate mastery?
Great question. We've been wondering the same thing.

For example, if we consider SLT 102.2:
- How will we know that you created a particular address?
- How will we know that that the address is actually "yours"?

In this assignment, we will investigate these questions by using your **PPBL2023 Contributor Token**.

<br />
---

## Do This First: Send Contributor Token to CLI Wallet
Send your Contributor Token from your **Browser Wallet** to the **CLI Wallet** you created in [Lesson 102.2](/modules/102/1022).

### After you do, check the status of your CLI Wallet here:

<CheckAddressHasContributorToken />

<br />
---

## What Does this Prove?
In [Lesson 100.4](/modules/100/1004), you saw that we can check if a browser wallet holds a token. The form above shows that we can do the same for *any* blockchain address - even if it is not the connected wallet.

If we know that anyone can drop any address into this form, then how can we know whether an address belongs to "you"?

Additionally, the form above is only looking for ***any*** PPBL2023 token, not yours in particular.

If you understand these problems, welcome to an exciting frontier of blockchain development! Now we are ready to think a bit more about on-chain proof.

<br />

## Check if Tx has been sent from address
Instead of looking at the UTxOs that are *currently* at a wallet address, we can look at the transactions that have been sent to and from that address.

### UTxO = current state
Remember that UTxOs are *current*. UTxOs represent the status, right now, of all value on the blockchain.

### Transaction = historical record
If we want to look at the history of blockchain, we must look at transactions. We can look at the record of any Tx, the inputs it consumed, and the outputs it created.

### We can check whether an address has ever sent the token:

<CheckTxFromAddressWithPolicyID />

## Still, what does *that* prove?

Keep thinking about it as you work on the assigment below. In this course, we will keep asking.

<br />

## Here is your assignment:
Build two transactions with the **CLI wallet** you built in [Lesson 102.2](/modules/102/1022). By completing this assignment, you will create an on-chain record that your Browser Wallet and CLI Wallet are associated with each other.

1. Send a `splitUTxO` transaction from your CLI Wallet and back to itself with three outputs. One output should contain 10 ada, another with 15, and one with 25.
2. Send your Contributor Token from your CLI wallet back to your browser wallet.

## Tx #1: How to build a split UTxO Transaction:
```bash
cardano-cli transaction build \
--babbage-era \
--testnet-magic 1 \
--tx-in $TXIN_LOVELACE \
--tx-out $SENDER_ADDRESS+10000000 \
--tx-out $SENDER_ADDRESS+15000000 \
--tx-out $SENDER_ADDRESS+25000000 \
--change-address $SENDER_ADDRESS \
--out-file split-utxo.raw

cardano-cli transaction sign \
--signing-key-file $SENDER_KEY \
--testnet-magic 1 \
--tx-body-file split-utxo.raw \
--out-file split-utxo.signed

cardano-cli transaction submit \
--tx-file split-utxo.signed \
--testnet-magic 1
```

## Tx #2: How to send a Cardano Native Asset in a transaction:
```bash
cardano-cli transaction build \
--babbage-era \
--testnet-magic 1 \
--tx-in $TXIN_LOVELACE \
--tx-in $TXIN_CONTRIB \
--tx-out $BROWSER_ADDRESS+"1500000 + 1 $CONTRIBUTOR_ASSET" \
--change-address $SENDER_ADDRESS \
--out-file send-contrib-token.raw

cardano-cli transaction sign \
--signing-key-file $SENDER_KEY \
--testnet-magic 1 \
--tx-body-file send-contrib-token.raw \
--out-file send-contrib-token.signed

cardano-cli transaction submit \
--tx-file send-contrib-token.signed \
--testnet-magic 1
```

## You will know you are successful if:
<CheckAssociatedWallet />
