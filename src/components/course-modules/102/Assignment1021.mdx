# Mastery Assignment: Build Two Transactions
This is a guided Mastery Assignment. We will help you get started on a task, and hopefully you will learn some new things along the way. When you are done, there will be on-chain evidence of your success!

Along the way, we will encounter new questions about how the blockchain works.

## In this assignment you demonstrate mastery of these learning targets:
<SLTSmall moduleNumber={102} id="102.1" />
<SLTSmall moduleNumber={102} id="102.2" />
<SLTSmall moduleNumber={102} id="102.3" />


## How will I demonstrate mastery?
Great question. We've been wondering the same thing!

For example, if we consider SLT 102.2:
- How will we know that you created a particular address?
- How will we know that that the address is actually yours?

In this assignment, we will begin to explore how a Contributor Token can be used.

## Using the Contributor Token

Send your Contributor Token from your **Browser Wallet** to the address you created in [Lesson 102.2](/modules/102/1022). After you do, check your status here:

<CheckAddressHasContributorToken />

<br />
---

## Does this Count as Proof of Mastery?
Using the form

It is time for some on chain proof. Use this form to check if you have sent your Contrib token to this address...

### But is it really Proof?
That is ok, but how do we know this is your address? You could have given us any address, really! If you are asking this question - welcome to the party! Now we are ready to think a bit more about your Contributor token.

<br />

## Check if Tx has been sent from address
Instead of looking at the UTxOs that are *currently* at a wallet address, we can look at the transactions that have been sent to and from that address.

### UTxO = current state

### Transaction = historical record


<CheckTxFromAddressWithPolicyID />

<br />
---

## So here is your assignment:
Build two transactions with the wallet you generated in [Lesson 102.2](/modules/102/1022).

1. Send a `splitUTxO` transaction from this wallet and back to this wallet with three outputs. One output should contain 10 ada, another with 15, and one with 25.
2. Send your Contributor Token from your CLI wallet back to your browser wallet.


a. get connected Address
b. query this address for a Tx In with Contrib Token
c. get the address of wallet that send tx in (b)
d. check that address in (c) sent a Tx that satisfies (1) above.
