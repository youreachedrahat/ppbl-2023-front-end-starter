## Learning Target Review
<SLTSmall moduleNumber={101} id={"101.1"} />
After trying some of the approaches outlined in Lessons 101.3 through 101.6, can you compile a validator to UPLC?

Every time you write a new smart contract, you will need to compile it, so as you keep learning, you will continue to use this new skill.

<SLTSmall moduleNumber={101} id={"101.2"} />
We have some UPLC ready to be used, but we haven't seen it in action. We will continue to think about this learning target in the next few modules.




## Evidence or Proof?


## Abstraction + Convenience
We looked at four ways to write a validator and build it to Plutus Core. If you were successful, you should now have one or more `always-succeeds.plutus` files like the ones below. 

As we built our first plutus scripts, a new problem emerged. Our Always Succeeds scripts did not look the same:

## Building Addresses
- Add slide

import MDXLessonLayout from "@/src/components/lms/Lesson/MDXLessonLayout.tsx";
export default ({ children }) => <MDXLessonLayout>{children}</MDXLessonLayout>;
