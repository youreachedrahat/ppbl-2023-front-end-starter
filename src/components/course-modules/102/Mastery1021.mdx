## Demonstrate Mastery
- How will we know that you created an address?
- How will we know that it is yours?
To demonstrate mastery of SLT 102.2, send your PPBL 2023 to the new address you generated with `cardano-cli`.

If you feel uncertain about doing this, try sending just a few `tAda` first. Then, look for your address on [Cardanoscan Preprod](https://preprod.cardanoscan.io), to confirm that the transaction worked.

- On the front end, a confirmation form
- Which raises the question: how will we know this address was yours? Contributor tokens provide an answer
	- (Side note: can we write a contract so that datum can be left behind only if contrib token was present? could mint, of course...)

## Proof of Mastery?

It is time for some on chain proof. Use this form to check if you have sent your Contrib token to this address...

<CheckAddress />

### But is it really Proof?

That is ok, but how do we know this is your address? You could have given us any address, really! If you are asking this question - welcome to the party! Now we are ready to think a bit more about your Contributor token.

## Check UTxOs at Address:
With simple Koios MediaQueryList

We would like to use this Koios query, but it does not really work.

## Check if Tx has been sent from address
With a GraphQL query
<CheckTxFromAddressWithPolicyID />
